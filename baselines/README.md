`run_joint_plan.py`: Running geometric-sampling-based path planning on a two-part assembly. 

`run_joint_plan_batch.py`: Batch experiment script for executing ``run_joint_plan.py`` on many two-part assemblies in parallel.

`run_multi_plan.py`: Running geometric-sampling-based path planning and sequence planning on a multi-part assembly. 

`run_multi_plan_batch.py`: Batch experiment script for executing ``run_multi_plan.py`` on many multi-part assemblies in parallel.

``pyplanners/`` is a base Python library for geometric-sampling-based motion planning, mostly copied and modified based on this great repository https://github.com/caelan/motion-planners.
